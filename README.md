# Mememe-1.1
This is my version of the Mememe project from Udacity's iOS Developer nanodegree program.


## Mememe 1.0 Project
This meme-generating app is simple, fun, and easy to use. 
Here's the first meme I made with my own app. 
Yup that's me, during COVID.

### Memes
Memes generated by this app consist of a photo and two text fields. 

### Photo
Use the appropriate buttons in the tool bar to select a photo from your photo album or take a new photo with your device. 
A new photo may be selected or taken at any time and will replace the current photo.
After selecting a photo you may crop it as needed or accept the presented cropping.
You may re-crop the photo at any time using the crop button in the tool bar.

### Portrait vs. Landscape Views
Changing your screen orientation may create unwanted space around your photo.
To correct for this, you may crop your photo differently for landscape vs. portrait views.
Each view will return to its last-used crop when you change the orientation of your device.

### Text
You may enter text into either or both of the provided text fields.
To remove the default text you may enter a space; this will remove the field from view.

### Sharing
Once your meme looks the way you want, use the share button in tool bar to save or share it.
You may save your meme to your photo album or share it using any of the methods your phone provides.
Once the meme is shared, you may create a new new meme by changing the elements of the current meme or restarting the app.
Note that the app will not remember your meme once you change it.

### Future Features Under Consideration
- Save memes to a list so they can be returned to, edited, and re-used.
- Change the appearance and/or location of the text fields.
