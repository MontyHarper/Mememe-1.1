# Mememe-1.2
This is my version of the Mememe project from Udacity's iOS Developer nanodegree program.


## Mememe 2.0 Project
This meme-generating app is simple, fun, and easy to use. 
Here's the first meme I made with my own app. 
Yup that's me, during COVID.

### Memes
Memes generated by this app consist of a photo and two text fields.
Memes can be shared and saved.
However, the app always launches with a clean slate.
Future versions will include the ability to save memes permanently. 

### Navigation
The Saved Memes view can display a list of memes as a table or collection.
Select a meme to view it full-sized. 
From the detail view you may edit, delete, or share the meme.
Caution: tapping the trash can will immediately and permanently delete the visible meme!

### Editor - Photo
You may slect a photo from your photo album or take a new photo with your device. 
A new photo may be selected or taken at any time and will replace the current photo.
After selecting a photo you may crop it as needed using the crop button in the tool bar.
The first time you crop a photo, it will be presented with a cropping frame that fills the screen.
You can change the aspect ratio by dragging the frame or selecting common ratios from a menu.

### Editor - Portrait vs. Landscape Views
The app allows you to make two versions of your meme; one for portrait and one for landscape orientation.
Once you crop your image in a particular orientation, that crop will be saved, 
and will appear whenever your device is held in that same orientation.

### Editor - Text
You may enter text into either or both of the provided text fields.
To remove a text field from view, replace the default text with a space (spacebar).

### Sharing
From the Saved Memes view, tap the meme you wish to share to view it full-sized.
If the meme is complete, the share button will be active.
If not, you may tap the edit button to complete the meme.
The share button will open a standard list of options for sharing your meme.

### Starting a New Meme
When you first open the app a new meme is created for you to edit.
After saving your first meme, tap the plus button in the Saved Memes view
to open a new meme in the editor.

### Future Features
- Save memes permanently so they will still be there next time you open the app!
- Update the cropping behavior so memes of smaller sizes will not have "invisible wings" when shared.
